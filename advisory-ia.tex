\section{Planning}
\label{sec:planning}
\subsection{Background}
My school organizes the Upper School into small groups of teacher \textit{Advisors} and student \textit{Advisees}.
Advsiories are assigned at the beginning of each academic school year and are used for occasions such as Trivia and general competitions.
Teacher advisors also serve the role of guiding advisees on academic matters if need be and representing faculty in parent-teacher conferences.
With this in mind, there are certain criteria that the school uses when creating advisories.
Each advisory typically has two advisors, one teaching MYP and the other DP.
In order to ensure that advisors will be able to assess a student's academic situation, the school organizes advisories such that at least one of the advisors teaches each student in the advisory.
Other criteria are also kept in mind: each advisory should have an even balance of students from each grade and sex.

Satisfying these requirements creates a challenge for administration at the beginning of each academic school year.
My client, the Dean of Students at my school, is tasked each year with creating these advisories, and, as our Upper School grows year after year, this task has become increasingly difficult.
