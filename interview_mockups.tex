Okay, so this is the sign-in page that I've mocked up.~(\cref{design:login})
So you would enter and email and a password.

I'm trying to make it scalable, so even though it is built for you and your use case, I think it would be applicable for plenty of organizations.
So I figured I might as well make it multi-user.
\end{interviewer}

\begin{client}
Yeah, that's awesome!
\end{client}

\begin{interviewer}
Okay, so this is the dashboard that I came up with.~(\cref{design:dashboard})
So, you'd enter the number of advisories here, the respective weights for each for each factor, and then it would...
I was thinking first you'd import from the excel sheet.
\end{interviewer}

\begin{client}
So just like an excel sheet with everyone's names... all the columns you need.
Okay...
\end{client}

\begin{interviewer}
And then it would put all the teachers in this unallocated section, and then you'd drag them to the different advisories.
Uhh, if there are two many advisories for just this page, then this section here would scroll.
The unallocated one would stay on the left, unmoving, but all these other ones would move up and down.

So you'd be able to drag the teachers, and since you want to be able to move kids around after it generates I'll pretty much use the same interface with the drag and drop.
So after the kids get added to the advisories they'll just be under the teachers in the same column and you'll be able to drag from one to another.

This is amazing, and actually what I really like about this is that once I put the teachers in, kids can do the rest of this.
Like student council could do the rest of this.

If the kids are there and I put the weights in, the kids can do it, or even the kids could come up with the weights.
That's the nice part.

Now, are your weights...
Could you... like I see placeholder field, does that mean we could add more factors if we needed to?
\end{client}

\begin{interviewer}
Yes, we would be able to add more factors, but I would have to go back and make some changes to the program to make that work.
But the changes themselves would be pretty minor if we have the data.
\end{interviewer}

\begin{client}
Okay, well hopefully I'll get any weight additions from student council... I think they met this morning, so, umm, if there are any additional aspects then I'll let you know ASAP.

But, this is awesome, and it's simple, and I legitimately think that you could scale that and you'd have clients that would buy this.
It's such a simple program to use and y'know you could offer it for like ten bucks or whatever.
And I think if it was scalable, and you could support a school that has a thousand graduating seniors or whatever, somethink like this is exactly the kind of tool that people in my role often need.
Something easy, that does what it needs to, it gives me a little bit of control, but not too much, I really like that.

I'm super happy, and I'll let you know what student council has decided in regards to additional weights if any and then we'll go from there.

Alright, sounds good!

Thank you!
